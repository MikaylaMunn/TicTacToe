## Description

 ![Tic Tac Toe Page](public/Images/screenShot1.png "Tic Tac Toe Page") 

This website contains a game called tic tac toe. In this game the user will be asked to click a square. If the user clicks the square, an "X" or "O". Then their friend will be allowed to click a square and have "X" or "O" pop up.

The game will continue until one wins or there is a draw, meaning a tie. If the "X" wins, then the winner is "X" is displayed; same for "O".

There is also a reset button to reset the page to a blank game. In addition, the user can click the buttons generated after each move and see the moves happen.

## Roadmap

Some ideas for the future would be
> - Keeping the score for each one with wins ties and losses
> - Allowing the user's to add their names
> - Adding a leader board to shop who has the most wins.
